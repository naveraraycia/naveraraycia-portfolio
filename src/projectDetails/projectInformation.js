  title: 'Sim Card Registration System',
  descriptions: ['Back in College, our undergrad thesis is a 4-member group project built with the major learnings we acquired from our Computer Engineering course. I was part of the software development team. I designed the UI, helped with programming the frontend (Bootstrap 4), and assisted with some parts of the backend development (PHP, mySQL).', 'We established this website along with a Fingerprint hardware with the goal of developing a centralized Sim Card Registration System ideally for the Philippines so that all types of Sim card users in the country can have identification. During the time of the thesis\' topic proposal and development (2020), there was no Sim Card registration yet in the Philippines, which explains why we came up with the idea. Furthermore, another reason that pushed us to develop this system is the increasing number of scams and other Sim-related crimes done in the Philippines using prepaid type of Sims. There is no way in the Philippines for any authority to identify a prepaid Sim card user in case they engage in committing crimes since these Sim cards are not registered and are disposable.', 'For the software part, the website has 3 interfaces. It has an interface for the Sim users for tracking their registered Sim details, for the Sim retailers in order for them to have the ability to register the users upon Sim purchase as well as track the Sims they overall registered, and for the administrator in order for them to be able to view all the details of the SIM users, the SIM retailers, and have the authorization to update and delete their data. On the other hand for the hardware part, the hardware development team assembled the fingerprint device from scratch using AutoCad for building the enclosure along with soldering the components together and setting up the fingerprint module software so that we could get the captured fingerprint data and upload it into the website.'],

Looking back I could tell how much I have improved now since I could tell how much of a mess I programmed before. I could also see and understand now the flaws of the website we did before, which include the complications in hosting. Part of the problem before also included troubles in uploading the files in an online storage. Regardless of all the flaws on production, locally the site works 100%.'
